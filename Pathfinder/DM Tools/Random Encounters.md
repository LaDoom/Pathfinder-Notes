#### On the ship to Strange Departures

1D6

1 - an abandoned boat wrecked on some rocks, with deep gashes along the hull of the ship. (Investigation finds bite marks) A long detour will dig up an oil of weightlessness in a floating satchel and 8Gp. most of the ship has been ransacked. - Happend

2 - A Kenku and a female human kid cling from a wooden plank floating in the sea. They have no recollection of how they ended up like that, but can at least recall their names: the girl is called Sophie, while she says the Kenku is called Boomer.

The Kenku from time to time may repeat the following phrase: (with a manly gravely voice) “Get out of my boat you monster!”. Moreover, it also makes explosion noises and when it shouts it sounds as several shouts all together.

3 - A violent storm suddenly appears, the party must take shelter as the ship (reflex saves) is rocked about and the captain/whoever takes charge must steer the ship clear as lightning strikes the ship. 

4 - A knight of the sea, Tarus Lorkhar, who sails on a small boat from place to place, killing monsters and petty pirates. Approaches and asks for some food and news. 

5 - Several Bird Kyedi traders are looking for somewhere to have a rest, they will circle and offer to trade. They have some standard equipment plus 3 lesser Healing Potions, Bracelets of dashing and a Brooch of Shielding.

6 - an Underwater temple, those who can see the water and have a passive perception of 16 or higher notice a clay structure underwater. If not noticed on time, the boat’s keel will crash against it, taking some damage.

The structure is a temple of great height in the form of an obelisk, with its base reposing a great distance away from the surface. Its entryway is at the bottom of the seas, where light does not touch. Inside is an alter, clearly of the Sea Devils. in the center of the temple, on an alter is a blue gem that strikes and crackles with lightning. (This is a reskinned Bottled Lightning). 

If taken the tample will begin to glow in the sea, a bright green that may alert some Sea Devils.
