One of the first human nations, formed from a splinter group of the original invaders. The country is a collection of counties, ruled by local leaders who all look towards the ‘high Ruler’ a king or queen of royal blood who can be one of the Rulers of any of the counties. When one dies the counties vote for  who will be the next ruler. The counties are tense against each other but the nearby Astara keeps them all allied to each other.  
  
Culture and beliefs vary from county to county. Rednia is famed for its wines, but each county has a different culture, attitude and belief. Unlike the largely human Astaria, these lands have many of the other races, liberated from the Elves rule thousands of years ago, the many races have set up their own colonies and counties within this country.
