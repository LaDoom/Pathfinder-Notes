First Stand is one of the major cities in the Grand Coallition, it was at one point the heart of the rebellion before a major attack had the rebel leaders flee. It was the site of the death of Commander Yorden, an orc captain who held the city together for three days so civillians and people important to the rebellion could escape to safety.

It will be the first major city that players will find themselves in, as they arrive there will be some small event going on, as well as a clear problem that the players could deal with. Some travelers have gone on the route South to the town of Budding Grain and not come back. The guard expect that it is the work of a network of bandits in the area but that route is under the watch of the guards in Last Hold and not first Stand. Thus they cannot look into it, dosent mean that interested partys would be happy to compensate those who would get rid of them.Â 

At the entrance to first stand people will be confronted with the hugue statue depicting Commander Yorden, an orc knight with a cloak in a rainbow of feathers, the cape is the only part of the statue that has been painted and colours. This simploises the union of all peoples, banding together against the hithillian. The orc charges forward, against the oncoming army, forever still in the act that spelled his doom.
