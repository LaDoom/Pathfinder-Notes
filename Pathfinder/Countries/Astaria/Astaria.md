The first kingdom founded by Astar the Conqueror, who died in the final siege against the king of the [[Elves]] in their capital of Solvrenna (city of the Sun Goddess). His sacrifice cemented the kingdom and threw the [[Elves]] off of the main continent and away from the Path to the North. The country is ran by the High King, at first direct descendants of the first king but over the last several centuries that position has been taken over by nobility who are voted in once a bloodline ends.

The Kingdom of the Stars, founded by the men of the north, but now so much time has past that the people of Astaria look upon the North with contempt. The people of Astaria are a hardy and cultured group, proud that most of their cities are new, the remnants of Elven occupation completely torn down. 
  

There is a deep belief in the Stars and the reading of and understanding of the constellations, there is even a religion around it akin to Astrology. (this is a deep belief held over from Astar the conqueror, called Blessed of the Stars by his court wizard Abertach. 

The general architecture is built upon raising peaks towards the stars, unlike the segmented towards of Elven architecture, generally Astarian Cities are built upon hills, their main tower, town hall or castle will almost always stand closest to the Stars. Most celebrations are held at night. 

Their banner is of one of the Major constellations, the one that Astar was born under. There is a tradition that all people are born under a star sign, similar to astrology.
