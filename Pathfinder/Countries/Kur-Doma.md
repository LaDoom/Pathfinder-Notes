The everlasting land of the [[dwarves]], a great collection of mountains that surround the massive Peaks of Heaven, this land is the only part of the world to never fall to Elven occupation. 

The [[Dwarves]] there are proud and strong. The only part of the world to find certain precious metals. They are isiolationist and aggressive to outsiders. They care not if their neighbors are Human, Elven or even other Dwarfs, only that they do not intrude on their sacred land. 

They have much wealth and influence with their hoarding of important resources, having a stranglehold on some of the best steel available as well as the equivalent of Mythrill.
