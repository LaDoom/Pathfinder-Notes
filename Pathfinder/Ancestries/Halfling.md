The Halfling are a short, jolly and selfless folk who are normally quick on their feet and light of mood. not to be looked over though, as they can be as deadly and cunning if push comes to shove. 

### History

It is unknown as to where the Halfling came from, during the Hithillian conquest of the world, shortly into their assault of the western continent, they found the halfling settlements and lands. the Hithillian quickly overpowered them with their divine might and subjugated them. transforming their quaint villages into grand cities and enslaving the small race. 

Halflings, strong, reliable and determined, made useful labour and workers. so the Hithillian made heavy use of them, spreading the halfling across the world for the use of [[Elves|Hithillian]]. they were both arduous labourers alongside the [[Orcs|Orruk]] and assistants or servants for Hithillian nobility. Their similarity to the [[Elves]] making them pleasing to have as personal aids.  to the other conquered nations it seemed that one day they did not know of these small people, and then halfling could be seen everywhere. 

There was an event during the initial stages of the Age of Chaos, where on the same night, thirteen Hithillian nobles were killed by their halfling servants. such was only a small taste of the little folks fury as they bolstered the ranks of the rebellion. acting as spies, assassins, cooks and farmers, whatever the Rebellion needed, the Halfling could provide.
