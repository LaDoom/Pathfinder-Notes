The Humans are a dominant race in the world, largely occupying the western continent and large areas of the east. they are an ambitious and young people, the youngest race in the world, at least in terms of modern history. 

### History

The humans emerged from the North, their tribes united under the banner of Astar the Conqueror, who rallied the men together so that he could form a grand kingdom under the guidance of Abertach the Cosmic. They descended upon the Northern holds of the Hithillian empire and destroyed the holds of the Snow [[Elves]], with Abertach's command of magic and the heroism of Astar, they laid siege to the [[Elves]], tearing a great cut in their empire, instigating The Age of Chaos. 

During the Age of Chaos Astar founded the first human kingdom, which had no name until he died, when it was named [[Astaria]] in his honour. It is believed that the arrival of the humans had something to do with the disappearance of the [[Elves]] god Solvrenna, as shortly into the humans campaign against the Hithillian, the [[elves]] lost their command of magic, both divine and arcane. 

As the [[Elves]] were pushed back into their capitals, and alliances made with the other races, the humans cemented themselves as a major power in the world. Eventually other human kingdoms formed, the lands of [[Rednia]] and [[Sara Rayah]] were founded and the people spread and settled in other nations that would take them. 

Humans share a certain kinship with the [[Halfling]], believing them to be cousin races, during the founding's of the first kingdoms, the liberated [[Halfling]] were essential in the humans conquest against the [[elves]].
