The Wildfolk (Kyedi in their tongue) emerged in the lands of [[Tyric]], they are one of the oldest races in the world and commanded one of the oldest empires. They worship a god, Norika, Child of the moon who is both prince and princess of the night.  the lands of [[Tyric]] are dangerous, containing both an immensely perilous jungle and the longest and most deadly stretch of desert in the world. The Catfolk thrived for they were able to profit and grow in influence with their techniques to brave and travel through these dangerous places, making them efficient traders and travellers. 

### History

When the [[elves]] began their invasion of the world, the Catfolk were one of the first that they encountered and one of the last to be enslaved. They fought against the Hithillian with both their ferocity but also their wealth and influence with other nations. Eventually, when most of their allies were all conqured, the Kyedi were forced to at first defeat, before the Hithillian conquered them with trade, beaten at their own game. 

During their occupation, the Hithillian annihilated most of Kyedi culture and ruled the rebellious people with an iron fist. until the time of the Age of Chaos, the Kyedi had a strong underground resistance that always sprung up no matter how many times ringleaders and rebels were executed. During occupation most of the literature and stories about the God Norika were burned or destroyed. Out of this destruction came 'Keepers' who would remember stories through word of mouth and keep the religion and culture of the Kyedi alive.
