The Orcs (Orruk in their tounge) were once the slave labor of the [[elves]], distant cousins of the elvish people. They once, very long ago had their own cities and roaming bands of communes before elven occupation. Now though the Orcs exist among the allied nations to the east. Some city states in the [[Remes Union]] are owned by old tribes of Orcs.

### History

The Orcs were made by Solvrenna when she was attempting to create the [[Elves|Hithillian]] creatures she considered failures, aggressive, with short lifespans and lesser affinity to magic. She thought all were destroyed but some tribes escaped and survived, expanding into communes and great warbands. Though some stayed peacful and attempted to grow and live many of these Orruk tribes brought terror across the landscape as fearsome bandits and warriors. 

in the middle of their reign of terror, the Orruks were stopped as the [[Elves|Hithilian]] began their holy crusade across the world. The Orruk tribes were the first to be assimilated. Warband or peaceful commune, all were destroyed and taken as slaves for the Hithillian. 

Seen as lesser, foul cousins, the Hithillian kept the Orruk as labourers, front line fighters and meat shields in their conquest of the world. 

As the Civil war began, Orruk along with the other races came up in uprising, begining in the City of Candles and spreading across Hithillian lands. Eventually the [[Elves]] were pushed out and the Union of races began. 

In recent history the Orcs (as dubbed by human kingdoms) have spread across the world, largely in the United Lands, some of the Old Orruk tribes, whos names and familys have lingerd have grown to be leaders of city states in the [[Remes union]].
