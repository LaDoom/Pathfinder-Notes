Elves (as is the Human term for them) originally ruled most of their world, their towering cities dominated the land, and then civil war broke out. The resulting age of chaos led to their lands being decimated to a fraction of what they used to be and splitting the elves into smaller groups.

*Hithillian* - the original Elvish people who dominated the world. They are insular people who seek to preserve what remains of their territory. They live in cities made of towering white marble.Â 

*Eltmer* - The elves of the Wood, more in tune with nature. They were the elves who instigated the civil war, seeking independence and their own land. They got it, a larger fraction of the world than the Hithillian, but still only a fraction of what the Elves used to have. Eltmer are more in tune with nature, and the ways of the world. The Eltmer worship the Grove, a great sentiant land that guides the Eltmer leaders and turns them into dryads.

*Drothkai* - The Drothkai are the elves who sided with neither faction in the civil war and resulting Age of Chaos, instead, they seek a different life. These elves made grand underground cities and seek to work alongside anyone peaceful enough to trade and interact. These elves are darker in their skin, with deep greys or purples with white or silver hair.

### History 

Created by a being of great power, their Goddess Solvrenna, named the Hithillian. Her great strength granted the Elves the lifespan of thousands of years, long memory and kinship with the arcane. They originally lived in the Hithillian lands, unlike other races, the Hithillian were fenatically devoted to their godess, this belief made her grow strong and let her grant her immortal children great powers. 

The Hithillian, armed now as clerics and paladins of their goddess, charged on a holy crusade.to bring the whole world under the religion of Solvrenna and crush any other opposing belief. a campaign that lasted 500 years, the Hithillian organised, expanded and conquered the world. subjugating all other races to their rule and doctrine. 

This rule lasted just over a thousand years and the elves empire could expand no more than the cold, relentless Northen Lands. So it began to stagnate, corrupt and twist. Soon civil war broke out and a new faction of Hithillian appeared the *Eltmer* who had adapted to the forests and woodlands across the world. As the war grew on, a rebellion of all the other races began.

Soon, a third faction of elves emerged, the *Drothkai* who were a neutral party and they built great underground cities on top of the ruins of old Dwarf and Gnome cities. These elves adapted to the underground with grey skin, white hair and keen sight. 

From the north the [[Humans]] emerged, destroying the two Snow Elven cities and swarming into the western continent. In the begining of the Age of Chaos, the Hithillian and Eltmer were able to hold themselves steady due to their great many paladins and mages. Soon into the campaign against the [[humans]], Solvrenna dissapeared. Her paladins lost all their power, their clerics could no longer feel her touch and only the highest of mages could warp the world around them. 

with these losses the Hithillian and Eltmer, all of them were dubbed Elves by the [[humans]], were pushed back into a small defendable terratory. An uneasy stalemate between the two waring factions and the world around it. 

As another several thousand years have passed, only the oldest of the elves remember these times of glory and chaos and a new generation has began to emerge in their halls and towers. a younger generation of elves who have grown up without the glory of the old days, surrounded by the bitterness of their elders.

### Growing up as an Elf

*Hithillian territory* - cities are still as glorious and beautiful as they have always been. they produce the greatest art in the world. Solvrenna is still worshiped, strictly as the almighty. gains have been made in small campaigns against other races but no real expansion of note. The Elder elves are still bitter and angry at the things that have been lost.

*Eltmer* - The Eltmer cities are built largely in forests but some of their territory has expanded to full towered citys that could rivel the Hithillian. The Eltmer's slow burning campaign against the Hithillian is starting to give way as they are making good strides as they prepare to renew their attack against their bitter rivals. 

*Drothkai* - The Drothkai operate not as a nation but as a series of cities across the world, who work as a coalition and as allies. These cities all operate differaintly and are known for differaint things, these indipendant and coperative cities are the homes to some of the worlds greatest scholars and warriors.
