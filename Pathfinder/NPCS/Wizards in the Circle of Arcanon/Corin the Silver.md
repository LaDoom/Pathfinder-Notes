##### *General Notes*

The first apprentice of Abertach and the leader of the [[Circle of Arcanon]]. He is the advisor to Astara and avidly manipulates the politics of the country while he spends most of his time either in the grand library in Arcanon or his own personal Tower in the South of the country, in very good weather.

He has been studying the slowly growing rift between the worlds, being the only wizard who knew that Abertach the Cosmic planned to use planar magic to seal away Solvrenna. He killed Abertach so that he was the only one with knowledge of this powerful art and seeks to attain great power through it but Abertach had magic tied to his death that led to Solvrenna being sealed anyway and the world becoming isolated from the other planes.
