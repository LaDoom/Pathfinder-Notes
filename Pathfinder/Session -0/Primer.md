### History of The Circle

- The Circle or 'The Small Realm' was made thousands of years ago by many gods who lived around the world in 'the Wide Realms'.

- Their many races populated The Circle. Then, the Goddess Solvrenna made the elves and overpowered the other gods. Sealing away The Circle. 

- Her armies of paladins and clerics, led by the High Elf Eterial conquered much of The Circle, only stopping at the boundaries to The North where savages and monsters had the advantage. 

- The rest of the world was under the Hithillian Dominion for nearly a thousand years until a rift grew between the elves, from the ground of the circle itself a sentient force known as The Grove turned the Hithillian elves into Dryads and wood elves, seeking to consume the world in nature. 

- As this civil war broke out many of the other subjugated races rose up in arms against their masters, beginning what is known as The Age of Chaos. 

- During this great civil war the Humans thundered down from the north, led by the unifying wizard Abertach the Cosmic and the chosen king Astar the Great. United and powerful the humans and the other races of the Circle beat the Hithillian towards the City of Tharund, which was the Elves capital city on the western continent. In the great siege Abertach died and Solvrenna disappeared from the world. Most of her clerics and Paladins lost their gift, ensuring the crushing defeat of the empire. 

- Hundreds of years have passed since the victory against the elves, civilizations have risen and fell. Many still worship the gods long past and The Circle remains sealed.
