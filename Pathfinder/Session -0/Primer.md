#### History of The Circle

The world (Commonly refered to as The Circle or The Small Realm) was made many thousands of years ago when there were many gods, existing amongst with each other across the Wide Realms with their many  races populating The Circle. Then, the Goddess Solvrenna who made the elves overpowerd the other gods. Sealing away the Circle. 

Her armies of paladins and clerics, led by the High Elf Eterial conqured much of The Circle, only stopping at the bounderies to The North where savages and monsters had the advantage. The rest of the world was under the Hathillian Dominion for nearly a thousand years until a rift grew between the elves, from the ground of the circle itself a sentiant force known as The Grove turned the Hithillian elves into Dryads and wood elves, seeking to consume the world in nature. 

As this civil war broke out many of the other subjegated races rose up in arms against their masters, begining what is known as The Age of Chaos. 

During this great civil war the Humans thundered down from the north, led by the unifying wizard Abertach the Cosmic and the chosen king Astar the Great. United and powerful the humans and the other races of the Circle beat the Hithillian towards the City of Tharund which was the Elves capital city on the western continent. In the great siege Abbertach died and Solvrenna dissapeared from the world and many of her clerics and Paladins lost their gift, ensuring the crushing defeat of the empire. 

Hundreds of years have passed since the victory against the elves, civilizations have risen and fell. 

The Grand coallition, the first and most powerful country, a union of all races has began to splinter and divide as new cultures and beliefs emerge and clash.
