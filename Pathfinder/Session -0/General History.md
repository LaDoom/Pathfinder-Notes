The world was once dominated by the elves for thousands of years, building great cities and a boundless empire, subjecting all other races to their rule with their dominion of magic and the power of their Paladins and Clerics. They worshiped the high Goddess, who, strong on belief, was the only god of note.

  

Their civilization prospered, had control over all corners of the world and then could grow no more. In time it began to decay as their immortal leaders grew bitter and in-fought, grudges that were centuries old boiled and bubbled to the top and in-fighting began. Three kinds of elf factions appeared, the High Elves (Hithillian), Wood Elves (Eltmer) and Dark elves (Drothkai). The Dark elves built underground cities and stayed away from the conflict as the other two split the empire into rubble with their civil war.

  

Taking this to their advantage, other races, dwarves, orcs halfling and the catfolk of the south and east began bloody rebellion. 

  

To the North were the Snow Elves, aligned with the High Elves, whos task was to keep guard on the boundless North and those that lie beyond it.

  

In a blink, the two Snow Elf cities disappeared, only rubble remained of the once great architecture. Were there not a war on two fronts, the high elves may have been able to defend what was coming. Humans, armies of axe and blood and bronze came from the frozen wastes with fury and violence. The beginning of the Age of Chaos.

  

Any Snow Elf strongholds remaining were obliterated by the tide of Humanity and their leader Astar the Great, with his Magi Abertach the Cosmic and his five Wizards.  

  

The world was in a bloody war with every faction fighting each other, allegiances began then ended in days. The union of races carved out nations in the east and humans took the western continent almost for their own, leaving the dwarves in their mountains and absorbing other races into their empires. 

  

The elves were strong and held out for long, then, their goddess disappeared. The Elves' divine powers were swiftly gone, armies of clerics and paladins now left without their crutch. Mages in their hundreds reduced to only a handful of the oldest elves. Their empire burned away over the course of a single year, corruption spreadding in their upper ranks and cities falling. The empire was pushed back into a tiny, defendable set of cities and towns before, after years of strife, things began to right themselves somewhat. 

  

The humans developed cities and cultures, one great kingdom formed by Astar the Conqueror spreading its own influence while other countries developed. Abartach the Silver died, and in the violence all but three of his wizards survived,his first apprentice Corin, who, in secret, gathered promising youths and formed the Circle of Arcanon, the council of Wizards dedicated to the study of the world of magic and the arcane. As well as advising the countries and people as Abartach the Silver had for Astar the Great. 

  

This circle was made of people of varying races (three Humans, an Elf, A Catfolk, and a Dwarf maybe change later) so that the circle was not influenced to assist any specific race, one was the leader and had the most influence but all decisions, in the end, had to be unanimous. This leader has always been Corin. 

  

The world simmered for a while as nations grew and over one thousand years has passed since the age of chaos. The nation formed by Ansal the great is a massive power, riveled by an eastern empire. The elves have two great factions of Wood and High, with Dark Elven city states dotted here and there. The Union of races collapsed and reformed many times, now mostly splintered but with one great push leading the unification of the splintered lands once more. 

  

The core human empire has just came out of a great war. Even greater than some of the bloodshed in the time of chaos, a focused, violent assult instead of wild attacks at all corners. Hundreds of thousands of lives sent to their doom over the course of a hundred years all for an resolution that saw little gain for both empires except cities draped in unrest and tension.

  

Some say due to the bloodshed, some said it was the work of the demons of hell or the wrath of the Old Gods, long forgotten, but from thirty years ago, people of all races began to give birth to demon-kin. Some name them Hellspawn, Asmokin or Tiefling. The rural areas of the world began to become more dangerous as bloodshed started once more, roads becoming unsafe. 

  

The great kingdoms have seen to do little about this, the leaders not recognising most of the threats as real and the circle of Arcanon and their apprentices have been quiet, doing what they can from their position as advisors, most of them are old now, having found the ways to live forever, but with that time the humanity in most have corrupted, save one or two in their ranks who are noble and good at heart.
