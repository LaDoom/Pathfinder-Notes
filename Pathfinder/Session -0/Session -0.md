Current set up.

Players all know each other current set up:

Lydia - Half elf sorcerer

Luke - Drothkai Rouge

Mat - Orc Swashbuckler, looking for a perfect rival, overconfident, left criminal life to find a good fight. 

Kip - Catfolk Barbarian

Lydia wants cool dream sequences like in the Shadow from Yuggoth 

Lydia focused on utility, make use of that and have some story encounters. 

Tone is a bit more lighthearted, there can be serious moments but it's not Warhammer or the First Law in how depressing it can be. 

 The world exists around the players, have events happen or be refereanced across the world that implies things are happaning. 

Corrin has his own apprentice who is friends with Lydias characacter. work on this with her ^^
