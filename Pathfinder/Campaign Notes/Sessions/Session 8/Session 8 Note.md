### Locations

#### Edgewell Caves

Half a days travel east along the coast (Survival Roll DC 16) will lead the players to the cave where a small clutch of Sea Devils have made camp with their Water Wolves (Reskinned dogs) are guarding

at the end of the caves there will be a Sea Devil Brute praying to a make shift shrine made of the bones of men and sea life, tied with seaweed and kept in place by a ring of coral. This shrine is a small crack to demiplane of the Sea Devils god. Azrial can absorb some of this power, allowing him to grow stronger. This can only be done with Alanias Permission though.

(Following this the players will level up to 3)

The cave goes into a small temple, filled with traps and snares set up by the Sea Devil chief.
