The Duhuan market is a bazzare of twisting platforms, glowing storefronts and stalls. shady bisnuessmen balancing betweent the walkways of buisnuesses selling Nunpak, a drug that you drip into your eyes to see visions and helllucinations. 

In the centre of the market is an opening with a great statue of an orc helping up a drowing dwarf. here is the Golden Guilds office for the lower road.
