The Duhuan market is a bazzare of twisting platforms, glowing storefronts and stalls. shady bisnuessmen balancing betweent the walkways of buisnuesses selling Nunpak, a drug that you drip into your eyes to see visions and hallucinations. This square was one of the biggest achievements since the 'Almighty Flood'

In the centre of the market is an opening with a great statue of an orc helping up a drowning dwarf. here is the Golden Guilds office for the lower road.
