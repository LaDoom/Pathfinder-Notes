### The Festival of Orange Lights

The Festival is a celebration of [[Yantai]]'s survival from a great flood sixty years ago. called such as the survivors found each other by way of burning lamps from many of the ships to signal who was alive. 

At the festival, hosted in the market, people carry or hang lamps that burn a bright, vibrant orange. celebrating with street food, games and drinking. 

At the end of the festival, people will gather in the market square and hang their lamps from a great statue of an orc reaching down to grab a dwarven man who is drowning. 

It is at this climax when a member of the Starbreakers will open up a gateway to one of the parallel planes and unleash chaos within Yantai.
