at the end of the caves there will be a Sea Devil Brute praying to a make shift shrine made of the bones of men and sea life, tied with seaweed and kept in place by a ring of coral. This shrine is a small crack to demiplane of the Sea Devils god. Azrial can absorb some of this power, allowing him to grow stronger. This can only be done with Alanias Permission though.
