### Locations

#### Strange Departures

Lore - This moderate sized fishing town is a small stop off point for travelers and traders making their way to some of the more central cities in The Grand Coallition. Their fishers has recently been dealing with attacks from an encampment of Sea Devils, believed to be about half a days journey east along the coast. many of the fishermen here are wounded, ones wounds have began to become infected and is believed he could die soon. 

Authorisation for the guard to attack the Sea Devils needs to come from the regional Government and the mayor is firm to the rules even if it is to the detriment of the city. Hireing mercinairies to deal with this problem though is perfectly acceptable. 

Description - A coastal town, square buildings and red roofs A large, white marbled manor stands out from the other buildings (this is the town hall) and a domed temple of Norika with a metal symbol of the moon and sun standing tall.

#### Town Hall (Mayors House)

Lore - The Town Hall is also the residence of the mayor, who lives in the secure second floor. It is common along The Coalition for elected individuals to live in their place of work, as a show of dedication to the community. 

It is guarded day and night and the entrances between floors have heavy locks for security

Description - Rebuilt out of the remaining Elven ruins at the edge of town. decorated in colourful banners and the flag of the Coallition (red with two hands grasping)

Encounters - Ro-Jin and the Mayor Fernand have coralled a group of citizens to search for Merik, they are planning routes and teams.
