### Chapter One

Players begin by being all brought together on a ship departing from [[Tuas Merah]] to [[The Grand Coalition]], on the ship they are attacked by enemies, perhaps leading to the ship being crashed? from here they are tasked to go alone and do some small diplomatic mission. After this on their way back to the [[Circle of Arcanon]] they deal with a new situation that seems to have something to do with the growing talk of monsters and demons. 

#### Traveling through the Grand Coalition

The players will be tasked first with getting from the Port town of [[Strange Departures]],  will help the people and get a small elven artifact as a reward, by foot or horse they will travel towards their first city [[First Stand]].  on the road to [[first stand]] they will be attacked by a pack of wolves, the leader of which seems, larger and fiercer. more demonic somehow. There they will deal with a small situation in that city that will have a faint connection with the demons, a group of some kind causing trouble, the leader of which is like the dog, bigger and more dangerous somehow.

from there they head to the city of [[last stand]] and must deal with Lyndfallen, the elven collector of ancient Hithillian artefacts and a series of documents that are relevant to the strange supernatural events going on. 

From here the players will travel through the grand coalition meeting contacts of the Circle of Arcanon, generally adventuring with money and fame with each exploit.  

By the time they reach the end of the journey they will have met and killed the Demon Uylak who has been spreading his power amongst this path as well as he travels amongst this stretch on the parallel plane

This will end with them getting onto a boat to head to the other continent and get to the Circle of Arcannon and the hope of sage advice for the strange situation arising.

##### *In Strange Departures*

As the players approach the small, poor port town of Strange Departures they will mainly be tasked with finding a way over to their first city of First Stand. there are a series of methods they could take:

- they could attempt to travel by boat down the Amunn River which leads down towards the city. 
- They could travel by foot 
- Could travel with donkey and carrage (though they will need to raise funds to afford it. )

If the players decide to travel by foot it would be recommended that they wait a night as it is late when they arrive and the paths aren't very safe right now. if by carriage/horse the shop will be closed and anyone with a boat will be planning to go to bed. 

Sleeping in the town they could try to lodge with someone for the night or they may find themselves in the towns inn The Seven Swans. 

During the night the players will roll perception, if they do they will be awoken by a noise in the night, investigating it they will see two figures move in the darkness, one person is covered in heavy robes and cloaks that cover almost all of his body.  a high perception will show the players that he has red skin and a movement behind his legs implys that there is some kind of tail there. this man is being forcefully directed by a tall and broad man. 

From there they would watch as he takes him to the the general store, unlocks the doors, and enters. Disappearing from sight. From here go to [Strange Departures quest] 

following this they will be free in the town to spend as much time helping out, if they want to take any paid rout out of town they will need to raise funds for this there are some options for this, they could assist in killing a beast that operates in the nearby caverns.

### Chapter Two

#### Towards First Stand

as they move towards First Stand they will be accosted on the road by bandits who bear a mark of of the Parrallel Planes, a strange rune in infernal. There is also a ruins on the way that they are told of while in Strange Departures that they may stay at. 

#### First Stand

In First Stand the players will find themselves confronted with a city under the stress of an invisible enemy, there is a growing sense of unease in the city. The players will find themselves engaged with the city where there is a growing unease as an evil seems to be festering here. Uylak, a deamon from one of the Parrallel planes is influancing himself in the city in a variaty of ways.

In the city they will be approached for a task by the musician and historian Lyndfallan to explore some anchient elven ruins and find the remnents of a scroll that has information on the parrallell planes and very well might have hints about the oncoming of the Demonkin and the talk of monsters appearing across the world. The demon Uylak is using several small gaps between the relms to influance and twist. He aims to bring himself through from hell into the material realm.

They could also find out about the bandits and assist in taking them out, recently caravan from the Guilded Trading Group has gone missing, believed the fault of the bandits that have taken root in the area, leaded by an ex member of the Grand Army, a violent man who has been deeply influanced by Uylak after killing his wife.

This is being orchestrated by the local church of the moon as a way to remove a favorite to be elected to the senate and thus give favor to a candidate who worships the Church of the Moon.
