### Wild Magic

Molly's celestial magic is unruly and uncontrollable, whenever she casts a levelled spell she must first make a roll against a wild magic effect. it starts with a DC of 1 and raises incrementally until an effect happens and then resets to 1. 

If the DC is failed then a wild magic surge happens *before* the effects of the spell.
