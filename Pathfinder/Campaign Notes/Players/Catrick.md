When appropriate in gameplay, Catrick will feel the urge of the darkness inside of him. This urge to do violence will cause him to commit unspeakable acts of cruelty and murder if not resisted. 

When he feels the urge to harm, the DC for this test starts at 1, each time he succeeds at resisting the Urge the DC will increase by 1 until he fails the check. 

On a failure, Catrick will give into his urges and commit an act of violence, becoming the Bloody Claw briefly. after he has regained his senses the DC of the check returns to 1.
