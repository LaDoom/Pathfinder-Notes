  
The players are hooked into a small adventure that sees them in a small town, they will get into fights and figure out the location of an ancient family memorial, which leads to a cavern temple and an ancient artifact from before the Elves ruled the world.  The temple hosts a tribe of knolls that are a danger to the outskirts of the city, besides the occassional lighthearted attack, they haven't made an attempt on the stury rural place. 

  

The players are hired by a jittery young kyedi man to find the remnents of his ancient families tomb. It is said that his family had lived in the area for generations and used to be ancient protectors of the area. He wants the adventurers to see if they can find the location of his family tomb and recover some of his families ancient heirlooms.

  

Underneath what is the abandoned Temple of Solvrenna is a sprawling cavern that the ancient people used. At the end of the temple sits the tomb of an ancient kyedi warrior and his weapon, the blade known as Na’varer or Conquest. 

  

What to prepare

  

Encounters on the road to the town

  

As the players are walking to town they are accosted by a small troupe of bandits. Four of them, led by a man who sits on the branch of an overhanging tree with a bow.

  

Vander 

  

Vander is the half elf leader of a crew of bandits, they operate just outside of Sangrilla. Elves and half elves are badly discriminate against in much of the world, more so rural areas. 

  

He grips his bow with care, emerald eyes twinkling in the summer light. He is  dark skinned with braided hair, draped in green and brown clothes that make him blend in with the environment. It takes a moment to notice but his ears are slightly pointed, and looking at his eyes he has no pupils, just clean colour.

  

- He will try to extort money or goods from the party, he isn’t cruel but needs enough to get him and his crew fed and happy. 
    
- There are three other men in the trees, with bows and swords ready to pounce (perception check to see) 
    
- If the players refuse the group will rob them by force, attempt to restrain them
    
- If half of the crew are killed/if vander is killed or if it is clear they are outmatched they will retreat or surrender.
    

  

The bandits have on them:

  

- Arsenic poison 
    
- 70 GP total
    
- Vanders Bow/Sword (level 1 or 2 items)
    
- Potion of healing

An abandoned church of Solovrenna sits a mile outside of the city, it is long abandoned, only used as marking for graffiti. In the basement is a wall that’s been slowly chewed open by creatures on the other side. Behind there is the tomb of Mi’guis old family order.

  

When the elves first buried this tomb they set many traps along it, some have been triggered by wandering monsters.

Characters

  

Ezran Tiphon - You are an orc wizard apprentice of Sondas the Blue, one of the most respected wizards in the Circle of Arcannon, like your master you keep an animal on your shoulder, a small Mink named Snaf (your younger sister named him). 

  

When out on an envoy mission for your master you received a secret letter to come on this journey and do this job. The letter was magical, with the seal of the Circle of Arcannon and the letter burned itself when you were finished reading. Clearly of great importance you finished your business and joined this group. 

  

In the group are Floren the Tall an elf hedge knight, Ai’sha a priestling of the god Norika and Lysa some sort of halfling scout. 

  

The group does not know that you are a wizard, not out of secrecy, but because they haven’t asked. As far as they are aware you are just a scholar.

  

Floren the tall - you are an elf warrior, a noble soul who wanders the world after being exiled from the Hithillian lands, fighting bandits, scoundrels and beasts where they are found. You have made a name for yourself for slaying Black Murba, a bandit king who operated in the newly formed Remes Union. 

  

While on a job in the south, assisting in a siege against a nest of goblins, a fellow mercenary, Ai’sha, a Kyedi priestling of Norika, recommended you join in on this job. 

  

The priestling also brought Lysa a halfing and along the road you have been joined by Ezran, an Orc scholar who you are sure has some hidden strength. 

  

Ai’sha - you are a Kyedi, a fox. A devout priest of the God Norika you have dedicated yourself to the pince/princess of the moon and thus are a priest/priestess (commonly called a ‘priestling’. you can pick pronouns though the devout normally either use ‘they’ or alternate ‘he’ ‘they’ and ‘her’ dependent on if it is day, afternoon or night, to represent their fluid god) 

  

In the past few months you have began to feel a subtle connection with your god, manifesting them as holy magic only seen every hundred years or so.

  

You have been on a holy pilgrimage to cleanse beasts (goblins, and monsters of the ilk) from the realm. When on a job in the south you received word from an old friend Mi’guis. He is looking to find a group of adventurers to help with a job. 

  

You recruited Floren the tall, an elf warrior you were working with and Lysa, a rouge who is the sister of a friend of yours. Along the way a strange orc scholar Ezran joined your group, on the road for the same job. 

  

Lysa - A halfling scoundrel who has worked as a spy and thug for various criminal organizations. Finding information in any way necessary. You carry a small pendant, the last gift your life partner gave you before they died. 

  

Your sister hooked you up with a job for a friend, something that was a little more honorable than your current line of work. You entertained her and took the job, meeting the Kyedi priestling Ai’sha and the elf knight Floren the Tall. Along the road you met Ezran, some kind of Orc scholar who is looking to help with the job.
