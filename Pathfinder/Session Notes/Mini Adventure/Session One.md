On the way to the rural Town of Sangrilla, where the players are to meet Miâ€™guis Nervi, they spot (Medium perception to hear), on the road ahead that a cart has been overturned, if the players hear the commotion and rush to the site the driver is alive and fending off the a [[Bahgvat]] but if they don't know then the driver has been killed by a [[Bahgvat]] (Gnoll equivilent) and two wolves. 


##### The Attack

As the players round the road towards Sangrilla, it is cloudy with occasional rays of spring sunlight. The players at the front of the small group will make a perception (DC15) check to see if they hear the attack on the caravan. Shortly after the caravan is attacked one of the two horses will break its reigns then go charging down the road past the players. 

Upon coming up to the cart they will find it turned over, a horse dead and see a Bhagvat and two wolves attacking or picking through the remains of the driver. An older pot bellied [[Halfling]] called Oren Hilltopple.

If the players save the driver he will offer them 20gp as thanks. 

On the cart a chest that contains:
- a beautifully engraved violin in a padded case 
- 20Gp 
- 8Sp  
- A bottle of grease. 

There are also crates of wines and food.
