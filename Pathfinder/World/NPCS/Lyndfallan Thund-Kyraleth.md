###### *Overview*
A Hithillian scholar and musician who curates and maintains one of the most extensive collections of ancient Hithillian antiquities and artefacts. He had an extension to his house made solely so he could have space for his collection. He is famed for his poetry and drinking songs, composed as to both be simple and easy to remember but to the knowledgeable ear are actually richly composed with witty lyricism with an underlaying social message.

He has a deep fascination with history and understanding and documenting the culture of the old world, specifically before the Age of Chaos. He pays richley for any Hithillian artefacts given to him and is actively on the hunt for a series of statues that are hidden in Hithillian ruins across the world. 

Currently he is working on a collection of poems based on  his historical findings and wants the completed documents as he believes such an obscure and esoteric find could help him finally get the inspiration needed to finish off the final poem in this first collection.

  

He is a man who will say things as he sees it, honest to the core he will never lie. This is where his fascination with the old Hithillians come from, he finds their old treatment of the other races detestable, but believes that there were certainly benefits of the old world that should be brought back, and with his recordings maybe warnings of what should be avoided in the future. 

*He speaks in a snide voice but is genuinely quite honest and sympathetic.*
