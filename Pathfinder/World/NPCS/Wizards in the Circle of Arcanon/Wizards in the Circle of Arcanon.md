The council of wizards, formed the remaining three apprentices of  Abertach the Cosmic. Who died during the Age of Chaos in a battle that ruined the City of Tharund where afterwards the Elves god Solvrenna lost her touch on the world.

There are a total of Eight wizards now, most are very old, ranging from thousands to hundreds of years old. The most recent graduate is only two hundred years old. 

*The Council of Three*

The council of Three are the three surviving original apprentices of Abertach the Cosmic. They do not communicate much and there is clear bad blood between each of them. 

Corin The Silver  - The first apprentice of Abertach and the leader of the Circle of Arcanon. He is the advisor to the country of Astara but seemingly rarely gives his time to the country. Instead he spends most of his time either in the grand library in Arcanon or his own personal Tower in the South .

Frode the Black - Abertach’s second apprentice, when young he was the most pessimistic and realistic about the war effort, would fall into foul moods and was also greatly jealous of the other Apprentices, thus as a way of teaching him a lesson he was to be named ‘the Black’ for his life.  he is actually a fairly gentle man, well worn with age

A thousand of years later Frode is perhaps the most active of the Council of Three, he frequently travels, learns and attempts to help the people where he can. The black temper has never gone and he is still prone to ego yet he still searches for apprentices unlike many of the other members of the Council. 

Gladrun the Whisper - Gladrun was the fifth and final of Abertachs apprentices, she is a half-elf master of illusions and mute, only able to speak in short whispers or through message spells. She is the most reclusive of the three apprentices, living on an island to the east where she rarely leaves. Her own apprentice rarely pay her visit or mind. 

*Noveau (the New wizards)*  

Jav’kai Swiftsands - The first apprentice of Frode the Black, a catfolk of intense intelligence. He was originally a Keeper for the Catfolk, a person who remembers stories and history with a nigh on encyclopedic knowledge. He operates for the grand Coalition but spends much of his time studying and memorising stories and lore.  Apprentice of Frode

Jeram of Elbert - an old, excitable man who is completely aloof to his tasks, instead he finds thrill and excitement in wandering and exploring, delving into caves, lost ruins and trying to find ancient treasures and lore. He rarely attends the circle, instead focused on his own adventures. His ‘apprentice’ is a wandering knight called Mike. Apprentice of Gladrun.

Fenna - traveled to the far east about 50 years ago and has never been seen since. Apprentice of Corin

Sondas the Blue - A calm and careful person, not the most intelligent of the whole group but still leagues above the standard mortal, a kind hearted advisor who takes their job and duty seriously. They are very, very eccentric and has an affinity for animals. One animal or another is always perched on their shoulder, it changes every time someone meets them.

For his diligent work for the circle has granted him the privilege of being given a title of ‘the’ normally only reserved for members of the Circle of Three. Apprentice of Frode

Tyvahn - A powerful and subtle man, the most recent of the apprentices, he operates in the Elven lands but travels across the world. Apprentice of Corin the Silver.
