bordering the Astaran kingdom and the small piece of [[Elves|Hithillian]] territory on the main continent is the blasted ruins of Tharund, a dangerous, inhospitable place destroyed in the age of chaos, and even here small wisps of magic leak. This city is the border of Astarian and Hithillian territory.
