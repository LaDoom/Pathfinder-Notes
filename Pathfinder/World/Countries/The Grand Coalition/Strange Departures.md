*Description*

Strange Departures is a port town off the coast of [[The Grand Coalition]] and edging towards the border with [[Tuas Merah]], here the population survive mostly by being a stop off point along the coast and road towards larger and more prosperous settlements. while the players are here they may uncover some dark secrets of the town, such as a people smuggler trying to get [[Tiefling]] slaves transported through  dark routes to [[Sara Rayah]] who want them for their resistance to great heat. and also a group of hunters who are looking to deal with a beast that's been terrorising people. it nests in a cave just down the coast.

*Problems in Strange Departures*

- in the night strange sounds are being head, people being moved from building to building in the dead of night. sightings of a monster in the night the size of a man but with crimson skin and foul yellow eyes.
- One of the hunters in town has died to a bear while off in the wilderness. if the players find his body in the bears lair, an overhang in the wilderness, they will find that he had been tied up and left their, clearly this was more than just a hunting accident. 

*Layout*

Strange Departures is a small fishing village, population of only about 250 people, most of the people here are fishermen but there is also a Trade Coalition office here, a small general stores and the Manor of the local Mayor. There is a single Kyedi priest of Norika in this village, a few people here also quietly worship the god but most people are of the belief that there is no god. 

The buildings are in the square stone design with sloped roofs that is common of the region. many of the buildings are painted a bright white to deal with the great heat that comes in the summer. some others, normally the buildings of older, more important families are decorated with bright colours. 

*Places of interest*

The Seven Swans - The local tavern, ran by a husband and wife, their daughter and her girlfriend also assist with waitering on some days. they also employ a cook as there are normally many travelers coming down through the town towards [[First Stand]].

##### *- People Smuggling*

###### *Overview*

In the town of strange departures the deputy of the Trade Coalition is assisting in a people smuggaling ring who are taking slaves from [[World/Countries/Tuas Merah|Tuas Merah]] and the border with [[tyric]] down south through the Amunn River, through a tight run off that leads for a few miles on the path towards [[Sara Rayah]].  This people smuggling ring has now been used to exclusively move [[tiefling]] from the [[Remes Union]] down to Sarah Rayah.

The second in command of the trade Coallition, Kellan Forthright, is the one operating the scheme, he is being offered a lot of money by the smuggaling group called 'the shrouded passing' to quietly move the [[Tiefling]] through town and southeast towards the Amuun River where the [[Tiefling]] are passed across the and then handed to the shrouded passing and taken down to sarah rayah.  

The [[tiefling]] are held prisoner for at most two weeks as the shrouded passing get about three at a time and organise dates for Kellan and his asociates to pass over the prisoners. Recently, one of the [[tiefling]], a deep purple one with white birthmarks over himself named Vorill from has been breaking out of his cell and attempting to sneak off. this has happened twice now, the first time he was caught by luck that Kellan was out and about and the second time he was caught by Kellans associate, the mayors Daughter Noel Deramu who, along with two rough, noutorious dockworkers whos she's hired are keeping watch on him. 

With the second [[tiefling]] arrived, the third will be brought over the next night and a few days after that they will be moved across the continent and made slaves for the researchers in Sarah Rayah

###### *NPCs involved*

Kellan Forthright - The Secretary of the Mayor of Strange Departures, he was moved here away from the city of [[last stand]] to act as assistant secretary, with the hope of rising up the ranks to the more handsomley rewarded Secretary position in a less rural town or village but he has been in the position for more than 5 years now and is begining to get impatiant. He and Noel Deramu have schemed together to raise enough money to set them up well together in [[Last Stand]] by smuggaling the [[Tiefling]] through the village. 

Noel Deramu - The Daughter of Mayor Fernand Deramu, she works as a letterwriter in the day for the illiterate of Strange Departures, as well as a tutor for some of the more profitable fisherman to send their children for her to teach them the Common tounge. 

Nokalli - A troublesome Kyedi fisherman, once sailor who spends most of his time drinking or trying to pick fights with people around town.  

Pascal - A thief who came into town hiding from the law who became a servent for the Deramu family, Noel saw him swiping some gems from her fathers room on the day after Vorill escaped and instead of turning him in, offered to pay him to keep an eye on the [[Tiefling]] and make sure he dosen't escape. 

Vorill - A sneaky [[Tiefling]] from The [[Remes Union]] who is being transported to [[Sara Rayah]]. 

###### *Investigating the boathouse*

Going to the boathouse they will find that there are four boats tied there and one missing. it is clear that there is a post for one. if The harbor master is asked about it the players will find that it's reserved for the Mayors Daughter but she never brings her boat down from storage at her fathers house. If they search around they will also find a small pin hidden behind two crates. this is a pin of office from Kellan that he had lost scuffaling with Vorill a few days ago and has been unable to find since. 

The Following night a third boat will come in then leave poassing off the third and final [[Tiefling]], only Kellen and Nokalli will be here on that night. 

If the players decide to sneak close to whats going on it will be a contest against Nokallis perception as Kellen is focusing out on the water and writing in a journal. If successful they will watch as a boat sails in, the sailor a figure in a shrouded black cloak, their hands draped in long gloves. On the boat is a person bound up, if uninterrupted the two of them pull the body to the docks and exchange quiet words with the boatman (DC - 15) a success means they will hear the boatman say '*we will expect you at the meeting place tomorrow evening. If you do pull out after this payment, it's been a pleasure doing business.*'. He then passes a small envelope  

###### Introducing Kellen 

If the players have arrived here from the crash and are confirmed to be the wizards apprentice on their way to see the the local rulers. They are invited to the mayors house for dinner, Kellen will be the person to give this invitation to them (and if they happened to do a quest before they get this invite, personally thank them).

###### Investigating Kellan

Kellan works at the mayors house, doing ledgures and general secretary work for the lands. largely his role involves managing taxes and the mayors accounts. He lives in town in a small house a small walk away from the mayors house. 

*Kellan's house*

Kellan's home is a small somewhat cramped space, he does not have much, general living provisions and some small furnashings, books and a red rug and chair in a small living room. In the bedroom he hides his money underneath his wardrobe, there is a loose floorboard that he has hidden, in there is a golden neckless here worth 175 GP (a Sociaty check will determain that this is the equivilent to an engagement ring.) there is also a small sack with 250 GP
