The Tiefling are a strange folk being born across the world, it started about halfway through the 100 year war of Sarah Rayah and about 50 years after The Remes union shattered in to city states. 

The Tiefling are nor all red skinned demons, some have more subtle signs such as their skin being an off colour or merely small deformities but there are also many who are clearly Tiefling, with skins of many colours, horns and a variaty of tails. 

Tiefling are the result of the many parallel planes slowly creeping into the world. when a pregnant person comes into contact with something of potent connection with a parallel plane. there is a chance that the child would become a Tiefling. depending on the plane or planes that influence the child their skin may be a mix of colours but the skin colour generally resembles the more dominant plane.
