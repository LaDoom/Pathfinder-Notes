The dwarves are a varied people, some are shrewd tradesmen or stocky hunters. They have an affinity for mines and the underground and are some of the best at forging tools due to secrets passed from dwarven smith to smith. Across the world there are communities and cities of dwarves wherever there are resources. 

The Dwarves crystalise as they reach an advanced age and seek to return to the mountians of Kur-Doma and become one with the mountin (which is the remnents of their god)

### History

The Dwarves lived long ago almost entirely underground or within their mountains, living alongside their gnomeish cousins until poor times and great conflict with the [[Gnomes]] led to many of the dwarven cities going above ground to trade and survive. The many great recourses they mined quickly allowed them to flourish and become powerful. They became famed as the greatest metalworkers in all the world. 

When the Hithillian invaded, the dwarves allied with the [[Gnomes]] once more to defend their lands and the vast, underground settelements they had built. This was still not enough though, and after many dacades of resistance, a majority of the Dwarven citys fell to the Hithillian. the onoly ones that survived was the ones at [[Kur-Doma]]. The dwarves of [[Kur-Doma]] had collapsed all the tunnels exeitng their territory from underground, so they could keep themseleves secure with their natural defences. 

Dwarves under the persecution of the [[Elves]] faced some of the worst treatment, the Hithillian finding their stout, inelegant forms revolting. they would frequently punish dwarves by keeping them hairless. 

After the rebellion, many dwarven cities began to be built in free territory, starting afresh to renew the ancient, ruined tunnels of the past dwarves. Some of the Dwarven cities are near enough their own faction and territory then their above ground rulers.
